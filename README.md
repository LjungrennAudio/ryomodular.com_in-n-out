 an ins/outs module with no kitchen sink...

2408310003

this is an interesting remenant of something i worked on more than  12yrs ago back when the company first  started but somehow it never recieved recognition. i know see this a real solid full featured module that easily fits a clear niche in the market and i  reckon will successfukly earn a place as a regular choice of in/out module.

in/out is an essential if nothing more than because you gotta get the noises out to spkrs or recsoehow. extending thinngs, ofc it's nice to have input from external and also option for balanced cable  hookup, vasrious size sockets/plugs, decent gain/volume cntrol, monitoring, overload/clipping warnibgs etc. etc. etc.

it's i'm thinking a full blown module candidate in its own  right and will eventually see light of day as is and not embedded in anotrher biggser project.
